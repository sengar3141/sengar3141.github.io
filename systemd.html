			<p>As the countries are developing and cities are populating everyday, we need more utilities to serve this rise in population concentration. And due to climate change people are also facing natural disasters more than before. People get hurt more in numbers due to lack of infrastructure, confusion and panic. It is also very difficult to rescue people in time because of uncontrolled scattering and frenzy.</p>
			<p>Indian government selected 98 cities to be developed as smart city in India, and allocated 1000 crore INR (one hundred thirty-three million euro approx) for each city. The clear mandate of this project is to make city accommodating to its citizen.</p>
			<p>Many cities municipality and state government in India are looking for structures that are faster to build and cost efficient for public utilities. For example Delhi government  already build 100 mohala clinics  (community health clinics) with the cost of 200 thousand rupees each in past two years. and planned to setup 900 more.</p>
			<p>Due to lack of space, government wants to make multipurpose structures. And they are also focusing more on disaster management due to increased incidents of floods, storms, typhoons and the number of deaths they caused in last two to three years.</p>
			<p>System 'D', allows us to build small public buildings those can be converted into safety and rescue centres in the time of disaster like flood, hurricane, sand storms, heavy snow fall, earthquake etc.</p>

			<p>Each System D can be equipped with many modular facilities like first aid and medicine closets, air filtration, UVC lights for protection from germs, oxygen cylinders, patient beds, life jackets, blankets, solar panels for lights, life boats and other assorted items. In the case of emergency there is a communication system in place. And Systems D are easy to target and search for rescue emergencies. They can also act as small rescue centres in case of disasters.</p>

			<p>In the time of any disaster the first priority is to take people to the safety. Safety consist of shelter, food, water, first aid, fresh air etc.But making people reach to the safety or searching them is very difficult and many people loose their lives in this pursuit.</p>
			<p>
			The better way of doing this is to have more reachable local shelters for people and making people familiar with these facilities so that people can reach them as soon as possible in the times of need and System D will provide exactly that.</p>
