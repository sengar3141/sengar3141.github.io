			I am trying to describe here my experience of teaching this course for three batches over three years. Hereafter I will name the three batches means 2016, 2017 and 2018 batches as first , second and third batch respectively. So let's start ....

		<div class="f6 mb4" style="color:#777">
			<p>This is a 3 credits, three hour per week course. This an introduction course meant to teach principle of design and aesthetics to students studying information technology and mathematical innovations.

		<div class="f6 mb4" style="color:#777">
			The purpose of this course is to take students beyond the realm of coding and calculations and introduce them toward the human aspects of any problem solving. The course coordinator also have  intent to make students go away from the screens and experience making objects using hands, interact with people and learn to work with end users.

	<div class="project-content mid-gray lh-copy w-80 center">
		<div class="f4 mb2" style="color:#555">What Students wants?</div>
		<div class="f6 mb4" style="color:#777">
			<p>My first interaction with the students informed me that they are interested in learning software tools like photoshop and illustrator by which they can create good presentation for other courses and submissions and some of the students were interested to learn UX/UI design so that they can code better looking mobile applications and web interfaces.</p>

			The word ’Art’ in the course tittle make student uncomfortable because they they don’t want to be marked according to the quality of their drawings.

	<div class="project-content mid-gray lh-copy w-80 center">
		<div class="f4 mb2" style="color:#555">My observation before starting</div>
		<div class="f6 mb4" style="color:#777">
				<p>After interviewing different teachers I came to know that students don’t come regularly so I decided not to give group projects. </p>
			<p>Students concern about attendance, so many times they comes only to get attendances.</p>
			<p>Students comes from different cultures and financial backgrounds even from different states of India. Which is good in term of having different viewpoints in class and I can’t take anything self understood for the students.</p> 
		</div>
	</div>




	<div class="project-content mid-gray lh-copy w-80 center">
		<div class="f4 mb2" style="color:#555">How I Started?</div>
		<div class="f6 mb4" style="color:#777">
			<p>I took ‘Design Thinking’ as the base designing process to teach how a design is developed or the method is practised. I planned to give individual projects to students so that It will be easy for me to access and mark individual performance. I made them understand that good sketching and softwares tools are not the requirement of this course.</p>I also changed the place where the classes are conducted, generally student take their classes in fixed bench and front facing class room, I stated taking my classes in a hall which is converted to an studio. I encouraged students to write on blank sheets of paper instead of ruled sheets and used pencils and colour pens or black pen for writing (instead of commonly used blue), all these things are just to make the environment different from their theory classes to a more dynamic and two way conversation between student and instructors.</p>

	<div class="project-image center mb4 tc" style="background-color: #FFFFFF">
		<img style="max-width:100%" src="assets/mylearning/mylearning14.jpeg">
	</div>
  
			<p>After finishing first batch I realised that students finds it disheartening that I am not teaching them photoshop and other software so I organised three workshops; Principle of Graphics Design, Principle and Practises of UX/UI design and 3d Modelling Workshop which is also attended by students from different colleges and students from different streams of studies. And for third year I converted these classes to weekends especial classes chinch can be attended by anyone to learn pre-announced tool or skills, and the response of students was very enthusiastic.</p>

	<div class="project-content mid-gray lh-copy w-80 center">
		<div class="f4 mb2" style="color:#555">Choosing the projects</div>
		<div class="f6 mb4" style="color:#777">
			<p>For first batch I asked students to choose a product or service which they want to work for enhancing the user experience, but I realised that the students get more focused on details of manufacturing process and its limitation rather then working for the user. For Second batch I asked them to chose an aspect of Delhi city which they wants to improve of change, and after realising that they already talked with there seniors and have solution in there mind I asked them to exchange the projects randomly to one another which was very amusing for me and students too. </p>

	<div class="project-image center mb4 tc" style="background-color: #FFFFFF">
		<img style="max-width:100%" src="assets/mylearning/mylearning13.jpeg">
	</div>
			After going through the whole process I found out that students usually more focused towards the solution and other physical aspects of products rather then user, so for Third batch I asked them to choose the personas or user group for whom they want to work. Students chose old age woman living alone at home, rickshaw puller, people struggling with porn addiction, mobile game enthusiast and other user groups like these.

	<div class="project-content mid-gray lh-copy w-80 center">
		<div class="f4 mb4" style="color:#FF9933">Empathy</div>

	</div>
			<p> Empathy is most important aspect of design and most difficult to teach someone, according to my understanding and experience. In case of my course the topics are chosen by the student an therefore they are suppose to relate with these topics. for first batch, to understand the user and their needs and concern I asked students to interview users. Generally students are used to of making questioner and ask question from users which is most of the times either to confirm what they know or to get information which is very direct. We designed our questions so that it will facilitate starting of the conversation with the user instead of getting binary responses. For example for sneakers wearing user group we asked, why you bought this shoe? For second batch I also added the aspects of observing the usage pattern and marks of abuse or bad design within the products because the topics are based on different areas and services within Delhi city. For third batch which is focused on personalities I asked Students to record the conversation with the person and combine the audio in a two minute (max) audio file which is to be heard by whole class and give their inputs regarding needs and concerns of the personalities. </p>

	</div>

			<p>In all the batches students admitted to found out new aspects of users which they have either have misconception or misinformations. They also mentioned that the concern they were thinking are not the same felt by users for example student working for visually impaired thought having sense of the distance is most important aspect for their navigation but after talking with the user they understood that the level difference and irregularities on walking surface is more troublesome.</p>

			After doing the initial research and finding the user needs and requirement, we define our projects at this stage. For first batch we already have a product in our brief so we took two challenges for the products, it is either to enhance the experience of the product using design for five sense method or student need to design something which is aesthetically totally different from the parent object. Most of the students opted first options. I realised that in previous batch students, most of the time missed the complete ecosystem of the user, so in the case of Second and Third batch student created user personas and users ecosystem and then found out the problems concern with them which helped them in ideation stage about the solutions which includes user, relatives and surroundings too.

			<p>In case of my students they were always use to work in the company if like minded classmates, but I encouraged them to interact with students with different point of views and get ideas from them. </p>

			Being a central university we have a positive points that students comes from different parts of the country and with different financial and social background so for all the batches we conducted brain storming sessions of almost every project in the studio only. We used post-its notes white boards and all the other medium to record and conduct the brain storming sessions.

			This course is only one of the many subjects students learn in a semester, so I encourage them to make scale models or mock-ups to demonstrate their ideas and concept which they need to make in materials like extrude polystyrene, cardboard, metal sheets, colored paperer etc. The model doesn’t need to be well finish but needs to communicate their ideas clearly. Our criteria of evaluation is, we call someone from the college staff or intended user to use the mock-up or comment about it validity. In case of software or application students create clickable mock-ups which is presented to user on the device it is intended for.

			Except taking inputs from user or experts we are not yet able to test our prototypes in the field because of the constraints of time and course schedule, but even then I present the case studies and success stories in class to demonstrate the importance of testing phase of design. I am planning to tackle this for next batch using some other methods or doing some live projects with an industry.

		<div class="f4 mb2" style="color:#555">Challenges we faced in this course</div>
		<div class="f6 mb4" style="color:#777">
			Students have lots of homework and assignments from other subject so all the assignments required to be broken into small assignments and submissions. <br>
			Attendance and skipping the class causes students to zone out from the class flow and it is very difficult to take them along the process.<br>
			Some students always end up finding this course non-interesting for their career as software developers or programers but the percentage is minuscule. I will try to find some solution of these challenges for next batch.

		<div class="f4 mb2" style="color:#555">What I have learned and the Conclusion ?</div>
		<div class="f6 mb4" style="color:#777">
			<p>I realised that teaching design thinking is more challenging to teach to any students other than students of design.</p>
			<p>The requirements of the course need to align with the need of the students and whatever they want to do in their carriers.</p>

			Most relishing aspect of teaching design to engineering students that many time they end-up completing the product or they try to continue the projects in next semester as summer project. <br>
			In many cases students tried to get internships with the professors to complete their projects.<br>
			The course flow still have scopes of refinement and improvement but according to me the proposed course template for teaching design thinking to engineering students can be as follows <br>

		<div class="f4 mb2" style="color:#555">Course Template</div>
		<div class="f6 mb4" style="color:#777">

			<p class="f5 mb1" style="color:#333333">Choosing the Project </p>
			Student should individually choose the personas or user group for which students wants to work for.
			<p class="f5 mb1" style="color:#FF9933">Empathy </p>
			Striking conversation with the user is very important, encourage students to sit and talk with the users and increase the observation of the students towards the details of design. It can be done by audio interviews, observations ,may be a video documentation of user or shadowing the users. 
			<p class="f5 mb1" style="color:#99CC33">Define </p>
			The projects need to be interested for students and if possible it can be something which is not in stage of solution and part of trending discussions because it always make them think that the “solution” is already there.
			<p class="f5 mb1" style="color:#3399CC">Ideation </p>
			The Brain Storming is best to do within the class and help student to realise to encourage others and building upon other’s ideas. And if possible involve students from other departments and field of studies.
			<p class="f5 mb1" style="color:#663399">Prototyping </p>
			If time allows students can be arranged for good finish prototypes but according to my observation mock-ups are all right too.
			<p class="f5 mb1" style="color:#FF3333">Testing </p>
			Students users can be encourage to take inputs form the users for future improvements.
			<p class="f5 mb1" style="color:#333333">Implement </p>
			I found it is encouraging and make student positive in pursuing the course if they have scopes of taking their project forwards either by internships or industry linkage programs.
