			<p>We always want to have new experiences. Human life is nothing but collection experience. Some people like to travel or some wants to read book and some people just want to experience new cuisine. General practice of experiencing new cuisine is to 'Google' the name of place with food or 'food to try in ___'. Google redirect us to a website which is either a blog or a restaurant aggregation company. We look either for rating given by people of their food or ambiance.</p> 
			<p>And after reading little bit of the description we commit to pay them a visit. Many time the restaurants push their advertisement and ratings on these web pages to be on top or sometime a good restaurant remain down the list. Many restaurants opens and closes everyday. But in all these nuisances there are some food joints carrying the heritage of decades with them. They are either ignored on new mode of daily updating culture or they are isolated for current hype culture. The experience and heritage they share is available only to very few people who knows and respect them for their heritage value. The taste and aroma of these places carries the stories, the culture, the leg- ends and heritage of decade and sometimes even centuries. People those have experienced these places, when they wants to share them with their friends and family, they may or may not recall the name of the shop, the cuisine or the place and even if they can they can only recall few. We wants to create a product which make this sharing and experiencing heritage easy and interesting.</p>

		<div class="f6 mb4">
			<p>In this digital experience environment collecting a experience is only get boiled down to a photographs, selfie, a twit or a social media post. Even our profound experiences get crowded with everything else in our digital memory. By creating Food Passport we created a physical platform on which we can keep remembrance of our heritage food experience. We are making the old food joints available to people those are unaware and in search of their stories and legends. We are also making it easy to share our journey of food tasting to our friends and family. We are also helping user to create his or her own food walks so that he can recommend some one else of what he experienced.</p>
