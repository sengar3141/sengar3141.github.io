			While researching for the project we realised that because of staying together with the parents and family, even after marraige the dynamics of Indian house holds are very different from the expected work from home culture. The space available at home is also very less in urban settlement for crating a room or home office. Even in the case of coworking environment there is lack of personal space for the work related to graphics and other jobs related to creative fields. So, after ideation for 3 weeks and discussing and weighting all the possibility we came around the following design brief.

		<p>I sketched more then 50 concept for the object then after doing SWOT analysis end-up with the following ideas
