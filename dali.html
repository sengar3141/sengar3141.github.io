			<p>Dyslexia is a learning disability wherein school children do not achieve adequate reading skills despite normal intelligence, equal opportunity and adequate instruction. It is believed to have a worldwide incidence of 5-20% and in India, the incidence of dyslexia is believed to be 10% which brings our count of dyslexic Indian children to nearly 35 million. </p>

			DALI is a package developed by National Brain Research Centre (NBRC) that contains screening tools for school teachers and assessment tools for psychologists in Indian Languages to identify dyslexia. DALI is the first indigenously developed screening and assessment tool standardised and validated across a large population of nearly 4840 children. The tool is available in Hindi, Marathi, Kannada and English and development in other languages is in process.

		<p>The assessment of Dyslexia is carried out using a series of age appropriate, culturally valid psychological tests in native languages.
Two primary reasons why dyslexia remains undiagnosed in India are:
 
 <ui>
 	<li>Lack of sufficient awareness amongst school teachers and parents.</li>
<li>Absence of appropriate standardised screening and assessment tools in Indian languages.</li>
</ui>

<p>It is critical to assess dyslexia in language in which a child is provided instruction. Given the education scenario in India, wherein children are provided instruction in at least two languages and often
three, it is critical that dyslexia be assessed in all of them. In particular, it is necessary that the child be assessed in his/her native language. Due to absence of appropriate standardised screening and assessment tools in Indian languages, the diagnosis of dyslexia in India so far has been incomplete. DALI provides standardised, validated tests in three Indian languages (Hindi, Marathi and Kannada) and English as a second language.</p>

			<p>Actual purpose of these tools would depend on outreach of these tools to parents of children and school teachers as well as training of teachers and parents in diagnosis and subsequent management. For rapid replication and uniformity in the test administration, a digital platform is required for test administration and assessment. The proposed platform shall be designed and developed by Design Innovation Centre, University of Delhi.
